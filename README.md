\- Tech stack



The backend of the "" we will be using Ruby on Rails , set up in API mode . This will be integrated with Postgresql database and hosted on Heroku. Two Ruby gems will be incorporated to permit secure user logon knock (to generate the JavaScript web token for user authentication), and bcryot (to provide the password hashing algorithm).

The app will be completley free of charge, but in the future we might implement the payment gems (Stripe) for users to be able to make direct payment with us. 

The Front-end will utilise React.js, and be hosted on Netifly. It will communicate with the Rails API using HTTP client. the useState, useEffect, and useContext hooks will be utilized where applicable.

Testing will be performed using cypress.js.
