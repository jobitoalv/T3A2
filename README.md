\- Tech stack



The backend of the "" we will be using Ruby on Rails , set up in API mode . This will be integrated with Postgresql database and hosted on Heroku. Two Ruby gems will be incorporated to permit secure user logon knock (to generate the JavaScript web token for user authentication), and bcryot (to provide the password hashing algorithm).

The app will be completley free of charge, but in the future we might implement the payment gems (Stripe) for users to be able to make direct payment with us. 

The Front-end will utilise React.js, and be hosted on Netifly. It will communicate with the Rails API using HTTP client. the useState, useEffect, and useContext hooks will be utilized where applicable.

Testing will be performed using cypress.js.

R4 User Stories

User Expectations:

All users will expect the following features or functionality:

- It makes it impossible for users to use it unless they log in so that they can record their own events.

- The layout is designed so that you can recognize the events created by the user at a glance.

- It displays all the information you need to know through a dashboard familiar to the user.

- It makes it possible to quickly and easily create, view, update, and delete all event items.

- The number and cost of items in all events can be recorded and they are calculated.

- Create an input form that allows users to quickly search for all event recorded.

User Characterisitics

Three distinct target user types were considered:

- Here is a man named John who wants to marry his beloved girlfriend two months later. He wants to record simple plans and costs. In this case, he can record all the items and costs you need through Internet search.

- Chloe is an event planner. She needs an app that can manage various events. In this case, she can manage the lists you have recorded for each title along with the total cost.

- Mark wants to record how much money he spent on shopping. So you can look at the statement and fill out the account book how much money you spent today or a week. They can be grouped by day of the week and written together with the total cost.

Notes -

- It was created to record the event, but I think it can also help fill out the account book.
